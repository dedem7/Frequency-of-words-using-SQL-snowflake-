Data from online car store is given.
Each car has it's description in form of text. This text was standardized by removing all symbols except strings, then this strings was lowered.
The lowered standardized text was divided by each word, using " "(space) as delimiter.
As a final output, row numbers of table were extended due to increase of one row to multiple rows by number of words in text.
This table can be used as input for visualization (e.g. Power BI) to show the percentage of each word frequency in whole data.
